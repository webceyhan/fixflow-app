# TypeScript Instructions

Use strict TypeScript configuration with proper type checking enabled.

Define interfaces for all data structures and Inertia.js responses.

Use union types, literal types, and generics for better type safety.

Implement proper error handling with typed error objects.

Follow consistent naming conventions: PascalCase for types, camelCase for variables.

Use type guards and assertion functions for runtime type checking.

Leverage TypeScript's utility types (Partial, Pick, Omit, etc.).

Define enums for fixed sets of values and constants.

Use readonly modifiers and immutable data structures.

Use type annotations for function parameters and return types.

Apply discriminated unions for complex state management.

Use const assertions for literal types and readonly arrays.

Use async/await for asynchronous operations instead of callbacks.
